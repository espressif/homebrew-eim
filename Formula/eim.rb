    <<~EOS
      ESP-IDF Installation Manager (EIM) has been installed.

      Python 3.12 was installed as a dependency (ESP-IDF requires Python 3.9-3.13).
      Python 3.14+ is not yet supported.

      Zsh completions have been installed.
      They will be available in new terminal sessions.
      If they don't work immediately, restart your shell:
        exec zsh

      Run 'eim' to install ESP-IDF.
